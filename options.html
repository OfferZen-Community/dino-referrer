          <p>We're on mission to reduce noise for developers in their job search. People trying to recruit you is useful when you're looking for work, but just noisey when you're not. The Dino referrer is a way for you to turn that noise into rewards, and help companies find great developers in the process instead of just ignoring them. You can read more about the project in the GitHub Repo. </p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Can I see the source code/contribute?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes! <a href="https://github.com/OfferZen-Community/dino-referrer" target="_blank">Here</a>'s the repo And you can fix it too (please). A total n00b made this as a side project to test some hypotheses. So if you're that way inclined, please feel free to contribute.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">What are the terms and conditions?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We'll use UTM params to check conversions. They get stored in the user's cookie, but we'll tie all conversions to the initial form fill by default. You know as well as we do that this is error prone. This is an MVP, so we chose this route because it's fast and easier to trace.<br>
          For sign ups, the company needs to be a real tech company that's likely going to hire devs some time. We reserve the right to make this call. They don't have to use us to get your reward. We want you to refer people, so we won't be Karen's about it. <Br>
          For companies that sign subscriptions with us, we'll contact you to get all of your banking details etc. This is truly in POC/BETA phase, so please just give us a shout on GitHub if you have quesitons or suggestions.
