Welcome to the LinkedIn Referrer :)

## TLDR
Install the extension (for now you need to load it unpacked, but it takes a couple minutes) and you'll see a little dinosoar appear in your LinkedIn messaging area. Clicking the dino responds to recruiters with a message referring them to OfferZen with your unique code. If they sign up, you get rewards like swag and cold hard $$

## Installing the extention

We still need to submit it to the Chrome webstore. For now, you can load it unpacked using these instructions:

## Manual Workflow
Don't want to use Chrome but still want to take part? Here's how to participate manually. 

1. Get your code from your [OfferZen referrals page](https://www.offerzen.com/candidate/referral_redirect) (you need to be logged in). You'll find it at the end of the URL in the text box:

![Text Box with Code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33951316/225258972-3bf8570b-5111-47d2-8794-52d761cbc457.png)

2.Create yourself a template message that refers people to OfferZen using the code in the UTM Parameters. Remember, the more you explain the benefits of OfferZen to the person you're referring, the more likely they are to sign up. Call it flattery, but since they're reaching out to you, and you use OfferZen, you can assure them they'll find great people like you on OfferZen - although let's be real, there's no one as great as you ;). 

```Thanks for reaching out. I'm not looking for work right now, but perhaps some time in the future again :)
If you're looking for folks like me though, I can recommend trying out a platform I use - OfferZen.
Everyone there is actively looking, curated, and they have a 99% response rate.
If you sign up using my link, I'll get rewards from OfferZen and you'll also get a special gift when you sign up.

https://www.offerzen.com/hire-developers?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=dinoref&utm_campaign={{YOURCODE}}
```
Remember to replace `{{YOURCODE}}` with the link you got in Step 1. You can also copy your full link from the settings page.

3.Send to people that reach out to you. It doesn't have to be on LinkedIn - you can refer people over any channel. 

We use the UTMs to tie the conversions back to you and will let you know once people have signed up or bought a subscription to get you your swag and money!
